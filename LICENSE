KataForge License (based on Elastic License v2)

Copyright © 2026 DeMoD LLC. All rights reserved.

Preamble – Purpose and Intended Use

The purpose of this license is to be as permissive as possible while protecting KataForge from abuse. It allows broad, free private and self-hosted use—including for personal training, dojo management, coaching, martial arts preservation, research, and small-scale commercial activities—while prohibiting the offering of KataForge (or substantial derivatives) as a hosted or managed service to third parties without permission from DeMoD LLC.

Intended legal uses include:
- Running KataForge privately on your own hardware, servers, or devices for personal, family, dojo, coaching, or internal business purposes (even if charging students/clients for related services).
- Modifying the software for your own needs (e.g., adding techniques, improving GPU support, fixing bugs).
- Redistributing modified versions privately or publicly (with notices preserved), as long as you do not provide it as a hosted/managed service.
- Using KataForge in your own applications or workflows, provided substantial features are not exposed as a service to third parties.

The license explicitly prohibits turning KataForge into a competing hosted SaaS, cloud service, or managed offering that gives third-party users access to substantial functionality (e.g., API endpoints, UI, analysis features) without a separate commercial agreement. This protects the solo developer's investment in building and maintaining this domain-specific AI system for martial arts.

All other terms below apply in full.
